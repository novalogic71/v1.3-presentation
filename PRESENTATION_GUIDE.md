**Content:**
```
The Sync Detection Challenge

Manual Sync Correction:
❌ Time-consuming (15-30 minutes per file)
❌ Human error prone
❌ Inconsistent across projects
❌ Doesn't scale for large batches

Automated Sync Detection:
✅ Consistent results
✅ Sub-frame accuracy
✅ Batch processing capability
✅ Comprehensive audit trail
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- "In post-production, audio sync issues are inevitable - recordings from multiple sources, timecode drift, hardware delays"
- "Manual correction is tedious and error-prone"
- "Our tool automates this entirely, with accuracy exceeding manual methods"

### Slide 3: Solution Overview
**Visual:** Diagram showing multi-method detection flow

**Content:**
```
Multi-Method Hybrid Approach

Five Detection Methods:
1. MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
   → Fast, excellent for speech/music
   → 2-5 seconds processing time

2. Onset Detection
   → Transient timing analysis
   → Best for percussive content
   → 3-7 seconds processing time

3. Spectral Analysis
   → Frequency domain correlation
   → Handles complex mixed audio
   → 5-10 seconds processing time

4. Cross-Correlation
   → Raw waveform analysis
   → Highest precision
   → 10-20 seconds processing time

5. AI Neural Networks
   → Deep learning embeddings (Wav2Vec2, YAMNet)
   → Complex scenarios
   → 15-30 seconds processing time

Ensemble Confidence Scoring:
Multiple methods cross-validate for reliability
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- "We don't rely on a single method - we use five different approaches"
- "Each method has strengths for different content types"
- "Results are combined with confidence scoring for reliability"
- "System automatically selects best result or flags for manual review"

## Technical Q&A

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: What if the files have different sample rates?**
> A: The system automatically resamples to a common rate (default 22.05kHz) for analysis. The detected offset is converted back to the original file's timebase, so the repair is applied at the original sample rate. No quality loss.

**Q: Can it handle files with timecode drift?**
> A: Yes, our two-pass chunked analysis can detect and correct variable drift. For complex drift patterns, the repair preview will show segment-by-segment corrections. If drift is too severe, the system flags it for manual review.

**Q: Does it work with surround sound / multi-channel audio?**
> A: Absolutely. You can choose between two strategies: (1) Mono downmix analysis for faster processing when all channels have the same offset, or (2) Per-channel analysis when channels might have different offsets. The system will detect and display per-channel results.

**Q: What happens if the files are already in sync?**
> A: The system will report an offset near zero (typically within ±1 frame due to sample accuracy limits) with high confidence. The action recommendation will be "NO_ACTION" - no repair needed. This is useful for QC validation.

**Q: Can it detect sync issues within a file (drift over time)?**
> A: Yes, when using the chunked analysis mode (automatically enabled for files >30 seconds), the system analyzes segments independently. If different segments show different offsets, it flags the file for potential drift and provides segment-by-segment correction options.

**Q: How does GPU acceleration work? Do I need CUDA?**
> A: Yes, GPU acceleration requires NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA support. The system automatically detects available GPUs and distributes workload using round-robin assignment. If no GPU is available, it gracefully falls back to CPU processing using librosa - it just takes longer.

**Q: Can I integrate this into our existing asset management system?**
> A: Absolutely. The tool provides a full REST API documented at `/docs`. You can trigger analyses, retrieve results as JSON, and download repaired files programmatically. The CSV batch mode is also designed for easy integration.

**Q: What if I disagree with the detected offset?**
> A: The QC interface lets you visually verify results. If you believe it's incorrect, the detailed report shows per-method results - you can see which methods agreed and which didn't. Low confidence scores indicate you should verify manually. You can also run analysis with different method combinations to validate.

**Q: Does it work with video files, or just audio?**
> A: It works with video files directly - it extracts the audio track(s) automatically. Frame rate detection via ffprobe ensures frame counts are accurate for the specific video file. The repaired output is audio only, which you then integrate back into your video workflow.

**Q: How large of files can it handle?**
> A: We've successfully processed files up to 2 hours in length. Files over 30 seconds automatically use chunked analysis with overlap to ensure accuracy. Memory usage is optimized to handle even very large files on consumer hardware.

**Q: Can I run this on Mac or Windows?**
> A: Yes, it's cross-platform Python. The only requirement is FFmpeg/ffprobe in your system PATH. GPU acceleration is CUDA-only (NVIDIA), but CPU fallback works on any platform. The web interface works in any modern browser.

**Q: What's the accuracy for very short files (<10 seconds)?**
> A: Accuracy depends on content. For files with distinct transients (dialogue, percussive music), we maintain ±0.3 second accuracy even for 5-second clips. For very smooth content (pure tones, ambient noise), you may need longer samples for reliable detection. The confidence score will indicate reliability.

**Q: Can it handle multiple dubs for the same master (e.g., multiple languages)?**
> A: Yes, use the batch processing mode with a CSV listing the same master file multiple times with different dub files. The system will process them in parallel (up to 8 concurrent workers) and generate individual reports and packages for each dub.

**Q: Is there a limit to batch size?**
> A: The web interface supports up to 100 items per batch for UI performance reasons. For larger batches, use the CLI mode or break into multiple batches. We've successfully processed 500+ file pairs overnight using multiple batch runs.

**Q: What's the licensing? Can we use this commercially?**
> A: [Answer based on your actual licensing - this is a placeholder] This is a proprietary tool developed in-house for our production workflow. Please contact [your contact info] to discuss licensing for external use.

## Presentation Tips

### Before the Presentation
1. **Practice the demo at least twice** - know exactly where files are, what buttons to click
2. **Prepare backup content** - screenshots/recording in case live demo fails
3. **Test audio playback** - ensure audience can hear the synchronized audio demonstration
4. **Know your audience** - adjust technical depth accordingly
5. **Time yourself** - ensure you can fit content in allocated time

### During the Presentation
1. **Start with a hook** - lead with the most impressive stat (98% accuracy improvement)
2. **Tell a story** - describe a real problem this tool solved for you
3. **Show, don't just tell** - visuals and demo are more impactful than specs
4. **Pause for questions** - but don't let them derail your flow completely
5. **Watch your pace** - technical audiences may want more detail, others want high-level

### After the Presentation
1. **Share this guide** - provide attendees with the PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md file
2. **Offer hands-on training** - schedule follow-up sessions for interested parties
3. **Collect feedback** - ask what resonated and what could be clearer
4. **Follow up** - send resources and answer additional questions via email

### Handling Difficult Questions
- **"I don't know"** - It's okay to say "That's a great question - I don't have that detail handy, but I'll follow up with you after."
- **Technical deep-dive** - "That's getting into implementation details that might be too much for this session. Can we discuss that one-on-one afterward?"
- **Off-topic** - "Interesting question, but a bit outside the scope of today's demo. Let's connect after to discuss."
- **Skepticism** - "I understand your concern. Let me show you a real example..." [use demo to address]
